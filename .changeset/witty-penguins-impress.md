Update messaging to reflect that Wrangler v2 is still Wrangler

Move to "Wrangler v1" and "Wrangler v2" instead of using "Wrangler 1" and "Wrangler 2", which could result in having an [Angular-like situation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)#:~:text=Angular%20(also%20referred%20to%20as%20%22Angular%202%2B%22)>) where we treat different versions of the same product as different products.
